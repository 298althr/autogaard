By accessing the application, activating a digital wallet, or requesting an AI forensic valuation, you explicitly acknowledge and consent to these terms. Failure to comply grants Autogaard the right to suspend escrow wallets and freeze assets under examination.

                                <strong>2.1 Acknowledgment of Estimates:</strong> Valuations are predictive models derived from Nigerian market datasets. They are <em>not</em> guaranteed purchase prices unless automatically accepted into our instant-liquidity protocol by an authorized dealer node.

                                Financial transactions are legally executed through the Autogaard Escrow Protocol to ensure zero-risk asset transfers.
                                <strong>3.1 Asset Lock:</strong> Once a bid is won, the buyer's funds are frozen in the digital vault. The seller's asset title is simultaneously held in trust.
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-slate-600 font-body leading-relaxed text-sm">
                                <strong>3.2 Transaction Resolution:</strong> Funds are only released to the seller upon cryptographic confirmation of the physical asset delivery and passing of the 250-point secondary inspection by an independent verifier. Standard legal recourse applies to assets materially misrepresented at delivery.

                                <strong>4.1 Network Margin:</strong> Autogaard levies a non-negotiable, flat commission of 5% on the final clearing price of any vehicle traded successfully across the platform. This fee is instantly deducted during the Escrow Settlement Protocol.
                            </p>

                                <strong>4.2 Bidding Capital:</strong> To participate in live auctions, a Client must inject and maintain liquid capital (Wallet Balance) equal to at least 10% of their intended maximum bid, or hold an A-tier authorization token.
